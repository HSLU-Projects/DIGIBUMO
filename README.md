## Business Strategy

#### Summary
Develop a business strategy that includes the following aspects:

- Management
- Processes
- Information flow
- Resources and use of technology

To achieve this, the following steps must be taken:

__1. Analyse the initial situation__  

Check the preconditions for a smooth transformation process:

- Is the company stable or in transition?
    - Stable: Previous business model taken into account
    - In transition: previous business model is less taken into account
- Is management willing to make organisational changes to improve the information process?
- Which managers and experts should be selected to support the business strategy development process?

__2. Elaborate the business vision and mission__  

Clarifying the vision of the organisation's function within its environment. To achieve this, the following aspects need to be analysed:

- Industry knowledge, political environment
- Strengths and weaknesses of the organisation
- Uncovering critical success factors
- Stakeholders, their views, expectations and needs.    
    Categorise the relevance, potential and urgency for each stakeholder

Develop an appropriate vision that meets the following criteria:
- Name unique selling propositions (USPs) for the company.
- The mission must be achievable within several years
- The vision is customer-oriented
- Stakeholders are taken into account

__3. Model the business logic__  

Review the corporate vision and identify critical success factors. Evaluate the indicators to measure the company's performance.

To achieve these goals, it is best to model the flow of information with system dynamics:

- Start with the previously identified stakeholders and their goals.
- Find positive and negative influencing factors for achieving the goals.
    Evaluate the following points for each influencing factor:
    - Influenceability - how can it be influenced?
    - Measurability - how can it be measured?
    - Interdependence - how does it influence other factors?
    - Optional: Importance - add weighting

Repeat this process until the following criteria are met:
- All stakeholder perspectives are considered.
- Identify the central loop: it consists of positive influencing factors that capture the basic functioning of the company.
- Identify the stabilising factors: loops consisting only of positive influencing factors or only of negative influencing factors must be stabilised by factors with the opposite sign.

The following aspects can be derived from this diagram:
- Critical success factors: positive factors of the central loop or have a positive effect on many other influencing factors.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These measure the critical success factors.
- Risks: critical success factors that cannot be sufficiently influenced.
- Necessary tools: to address and manage the identified risks.

Set realistic targets for all KPIs and implement the identified tools in the system model.  
The final result forms the basis for developing appropriate corporate governance: Products and core processes, staff roles, core competencies and promotion, and the process structure.

__4. Describe products and core processes__  

_Products_ are derived directly from customer needs and technical possibilities. It must always be checked whether there is a sufficient standardised solution on the market that meets the problems or whether it is necessary to produce it oneself.
The following information must be recorded for each product:

- Product name
- Customer needs covered
- Required technology
- Related core process
- Use of information (coordination or operation)
- Product life cycle
- Current phase in the product life cycle

Products are independent influencing factors in the system model. To ensure that a product is feasible, its relationship to the critical success factors must be closely examined. Together with the resource requirements for development and operation, the priority/value of the product can be derived.

_Core processes_ are the chains of activities related to a product or service that must be performed from the formulation of a customer order to the completion of the order.
The following information must be tracked for all core processes:

- Process name
- Necessary activities
- Core competences for the execution

__5. Define necessary roles and competences__
A list of necessary competences can be derived from the products and core processes. These competences can be collected and grouped into roles in a meaningful way.  Attributes should be recorded for each role:

- Name of the role
- Core competencies
- Development opportunities

#### Case Study Solution
Stakeholders in the project CDNet:

| **Stakeholder** 	                | **Objectives** 	             | **Influencing factors** 	    | 
|-----------------	                |----------------	             |-------------------------	    |
| _Music Producers_                 | High volume at low price       | Efficient settlement process |
| _Music Publishers & Distributors_	| Offering low prices            | Technical improvements      	|
|                               	|                                | Building a plattform      	|
| Dealers        	                | Know the customers             |                          	|
| _Customers_      	                | Good experience at low price   |                          	|

From the stakeholders the business logic can be derived.

The role and potential of digitisation is enormous. The goal of CDNet should be to build a streaming platform that meets the following needs:

- Music producers could record their music with little effort and in high volumes and upload it to the platform
- Music could be sold directly to the customer (B2C) instead of using retailers as middlemen
- Data from customers could be collected to make direct sales suggestions to customers. In addition, the data could be analysed as a whole and sold to music producers.

The disadvantage would be the big competition (Apple Music and Spotify). Therefore, the selection of a suitable business model and appropriate marketing is crucial.

## Organizational Model
he operational structure has to be aligned with the business logic but in a process perspective. The organizational model is derived from the core processes, the core competences and the staff roles.

__1. Define process-structures__
A process definition includes:

- Designation of the product/service to be delivered
- Required technology, information and resources
- Responsibility for initiating and controlling the process
- All staff roles involved

Process flows change with the product life cycle and experience gained and therefore need to be flexible and adaptable.  
At the beginning: A low level of firmly defined activities and dependencies is typical.  
At the end of the life cycle: High quantities must be handled as cost-effectively and quickly as possible. Efficient organisational forms therefore become a critical success factor that requires a high degree of structuring.

__2. Define organisational structure__
Based on the developed business logic, the most appropriate organisational structure must be found. Responsibilities, management structure and information flows need to be defined.

Flat hierarchies have a higher need for information distribution, while in hierarchical structures the flow of information is easier to define. Normally, specific knowledge is built up in the organisational units, while management information flows along the relationships between superiors and subordinates within the organisation.
There is a variety of organisational superstructures to chose from:

![Organizational Superstructures](./resources/org_superstructures.png)

- Product line-based structure: the product line can be clearly delineated from the customer's perspective.  
- Stakeholder-based structure: relationships with stakeholders are a critical success factor.
- Competence centre-based: knowledge development is a critical success factor or competences can be reused in a worthwhile way.

Working groups are temporary associations of experts to deal with specific, infrequent problems. The efficient formation of working groups is very important for the success of a company and should be taken into account when planning the organisational structure. In addition, the prevailing corporate culture should not be changed too abruptly.

__3. Define the spatial organisation__
The spatial organisation ensures communication flows and estimates its importance and frequency between organisational units and stakeholders.  

Communication flows can be modeled and weighted:

Based on this diagram, communication can be coordinated and facilities can be created to meet the respective needs.
