# Subject Review DIGIBUMO
DIGIBUMO presented an approach on how to successfully incorporate technology into a business model. Having 14 years of experience in the IT industry, I was able to reflect on many of the problems I have encountered in my career. For me, information management was particularly interesting as I could see why information feudalism leads to so many problems with a standardised approach to IT.

However, the CUBORO model was sometimes not translated properly, which could make it very difficult to read and understand. I would suggest revising it. Also, I would advise you to release the whole document at the beginning of the course - you might not believe it, but some students like to do preparatory work ;). 
What I didn't like were the case studies - some of them were outdated or unrelated to sustainability (e.g. CDProject and Peclard). I would suggest using current case studies with companies that are implementing sustainability (e.g. Patagonia). Then we would be able to see how existing sustainable business models work while solving the studies, which should be a goal of this course.
Another suggestion would be to use those lecutres to focuse on the project. I think if we would be able to engage even more with the project and would receive a coaching on regular bases it would be beneficial for the learning process.
